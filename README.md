# Trello
Hey, this the trello clone i made. It took me about 3 hours to finish, I spend too much time trying to use react-dnd, I've never used it before, So it didn't work too well for me then i wrote the dnd with plane Javascript. Didn't spend much time on the design but everything works fine:) I used react-modal as well.
